               <h1 class="intro_title">Yeah yeah. I know that «БОБРЫ» isn’t a very good name for a clan, but I named it that way beacause of a funny incident that happened on my discord server. One afternoon, we were sitting with my friends in a voice chat talking about the server, the clan etc, I asked evereyone to write a name for the clan. There was many many varients, but I chose a variant of one girl the was «бобры», all my friends were laughing and I. But after few minutes, I understood the it is a very cool  varient. I had 2 reasons why I chose it. The first reason was that it is funny, and the second reason is because it is very easy to keep it in mind. Well I told you the story of the clan’s name, now let’s talk about how to be a member of our clan. Our clan is in every game, so if you have good skills, you can gave a test in any game you play well. If you pass the test, the you are accepted to be one of us, if not, then sorry you can’t enter our clan. Also, you need to be a member of our discord server. Finally, I want to tell you thank you that you have read this text, I hope I answered all your questions, even if not all your questions were answered, you can ask me in the discord (my discord HAYKOV#9190).</h1>

               <h3 class="intro_subtitle">Thank you for your attention.</h3>
